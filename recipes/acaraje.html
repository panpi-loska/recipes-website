        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Acarajé is a culinary specialty from African and Afro-Brazilian cuisine. It is a fritter made from a batter of black-eyed peas, onion, and salt, deep-fried in dendê oil (palm oil). Usually it's served with a wide variety of fillings but mainly with <i><a href="../recipes/vatapa.html">vatapá</a></i>.</p>
        <p>Below we guide you step-by-step through a recipe to prepare this delicious dish.</p>
        <h3>Ingedients:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>500 g of black-eyed peas;</li>
            <li>500 g of carrot;</li>
            <li>500 ml of cooking oil (any you like);</li>
            <li>500 ml of <i>dendê</i> oil;</li>
            <li>1 onion;</li>
            <li>salt to taste.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Place the whole black-eyed peas in a food processor and pulse briefly to break them up without turning them into crumbs. Transfer to a bowl, cover with water, and soak for at least 12 hours;</li>
            <li>After soaking, stir the beans to loosen the skins, then use a fine sieve to remove the skins and black "eyes." Rinse well under running water, removing as much skin as possible. Set aside;</li>
            <li>Peel and roughly chop the onions. In a food processor, blend the soaked beans and onions until you get a smooth, uniform paste.</li>
            <li>Transfer the batter to a large bowl or pot. Using a wooden spoon, beat the mixture vigorously until it becomes airy and triples in volume—this step is key for natural fermentation and light texture.</li>
            <li>Heat the oil and <i>dendê</i> oil (palm oil) in a deep pan over high heat, adding an unpeeled onion to infuse flavor. Shape the acarajés using two tablespoons, passing the dough back and forth until forming a fritter shape.</li>
            <li>Fry the fritters in hot oil for about 3 minutes on one side. Flip with a slotted spoon and fry until golden and crisp. Adjust the heat as needed. Remove from oil and drain on paper towels. Serve hot with your preferred filling. (We recommend <i><a href="../recipes/vatapa.html">vatapá</a></i>).</li>        
        </ol>
